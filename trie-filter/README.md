##
This portable module provides a functional starting point for a chat/message filter.

Messages are filtered using blacklist associations via word length->suffix->prefix->word.  

The filter removes URLs within strings, extra spaces, and joins gapped words. Numbers and symbols are ignored during blacklist check.

Table structre:
```lua
	[3] = { o = { "one" } },
	[4] = { m = { "mono", "monk" },
			l = { "link" } },
	[6] = { s = { "square" } },
```

For importing, replace the 'fakechat' lines with compatible code.
